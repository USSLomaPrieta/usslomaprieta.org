Upload, manage, and display files from your server directories or page attachments in stylized lists or sortable data tables.
== Description ==
Upload your files from the front-end using ajax. Manage them securely from the front-end with the file manager. Display them to your users in stylized lists or sortable data tables. Construct shortcodes manually or using a point and click UI. Easily create dynamic paths to show different content to different logged-in users. 
= Features =
* Display files from your server directories or post/page attachments in stylized lists or sortable data tables with one of two powerful shortcodes.<br><br>
* Two shortcodes with over 60 optional attributes to fine-tune the appearance and functionality of your lists and tables. <br><br>
* One shortcode for uploading your files to your server, securely from the front-end of your site, powered by ajax.
* Optionally enable in-table audio playback of your audio files, with download links for each audio file type matching the file name. Works with regular tables, Directory Tree tables, and Recursive tables. Hat Tip to [Tips and Tricks HQ](https://wordpress.org/plugins/compact-wp-audio-player/) for allowing me to modify their plugin and integrate it into File Away.<br><br>
* Optionally specify separate paths for your playback audio and your audio downloads. <br><br>
* Optionally make File Away lists and tables recursive, showing all files in all subfolders starting from your specified base directory. <br><br>
* Optionally enable bulk downloads to a single zip file on File Away data tables. <br><br>
* Optionally turn your File Away data table into a Directory Tree, to navigate through sub-directories beginning from your specified directory. <br><br>
* Optionally enable Mannager Mode, a secure front-end framework for renaming, copying, moving, and deleting files, individually or in bulk. Only specified users and/or user roles will have access to Manager Mode. Universal access settings can be overriden on a per-shortcode basis using a password set in the Admin area. <br><br>
* Manager Mode security features prevent backwards access to directories, and notifies the site administrator when someone makes an attempt to do so. Security measures are in place both on the client and server side. <br><br>
* With Directory Tree mode enabled, use the new [fileaframe] shortcode and the new File Away iFrame page template, to embed your Directory Tree table in a seamless iframe on your page, to allow navigation of server directories without refreshing the parent page, and to allow multiple tables on a page without interference. <br><br>
* Easily create dynamic paths to display different files to an unlimited number of different logged-in users, using one or more of File Away's four dynamic paths codewords, all with a single shortcode instance.<br><br>
* Display files recursively, or from only a single specified directory.
* Formidable Pro users can easily create dynamic paths in Formidable custom displays using Formidable shortcodes inside the File Away shortcode.<br><br>
* Powered by themergency's Foo Table, your tables are sortable by column, searchable, and have the option to turn on pagination for large tables. <br><br>
* Easily create custom columns in your tables to provide additional information about your files and attachments. <br><br>
* Build your shortcodes with a smooth point-and-click UI.<br><br>
* Use one of the built-in styles for your list or table, or easily create your own styles using the helpers and built-in CSS editor. <br><br>
* Use the built-in CSS editor, or create your own stylsheet and upload it to the custom-css directory. File Away will enqueue it for you, and backup and restore it on plugin updates.<br><br>
* Easily plug your custom styles and colors into the shortcode generator UI.<br><br>
* Save up to five Base Directories for quick reference when building your shortcodes. <br><br>
* Extend the base directory path with the optional sub-directory attribute on a per-shortcode basis.<br><br>
* Precise control over inclusion and exclusion of specific files and file types on a global or per-shortcode basis. <br><br>
* Choose whether file links are download links or open in a new window per file type. <br><br>
* Adds a custom Post ID column to "All Pages" and "All Posts" for quick reference when pointing the attachments shortcode to a page other than the current page.<br><br>
* Choose whether to load the stylesheets and the Javascript in the header on all pages, or the footer only on necessary pages.<br><br>
* Activate the debug feature on a per-shortcode basis to help with troubleshooting path targets. <br><br>
* Automatically hides dynamic content from logged-out users.<br><br>
* No output when there are no files in the directory to display, so insert your dynamic paths shortcode, and worry about adding files to the directories at your own pace.<br><br>
* Control access to individual file/attachment displays by user role.<br><br>
* Disable link functionality, if desired. For instance, to display successful user uploads.<br><br>
* Choose by user capability who can see and use the shortcode generator UI.<br><br>
* Choose the location of the shortcode button on the TinyMCE panel.<br><br>
* Choose the date display format: MM/DD/YYYY or DD/MM/YYYY.<br><br>
* Comes with numerous tutorials and dozens of quick info links with modal window helpers for each feature and shortcode attribute.<br><br>
* Choose between file-type icons, paperclip icons, or no icons, on a per-shortcode basis. <br><br>
* In tables, choose by which column to sort on initial page load, either ascending or descending. <br><br>
* Icons are web font characters, so no extra image loading time.<br><br>
* Numerous other behind-the-scenes features. The shortcodes work to make your displays presentable and secure.<br><br>
= The Shortcodes = 
[fileaway] [attachaway] [fileup] and [fileaframe]
* [fileup] attributes include: name, base, sub, style, iconcolor, width, perpx, align, filetypes, filegroups, action, showto, hidefrom, single, maxsize, and maxsizetype. For instructions see the info links on the shortcode generator modal on your post/page editor, as well as the Tutorials tab on the File Away settings page.

== Installation ==
1. Upload 'file-away/' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Use the provided shortcode generator and use the codes on your pages, posts, widgets, etc.
== Screenshots ==
01. An example of a table with Audio Playback enabled. All audio file types with the matching filenames will appear as download links in the same table row. If an mp3, ogg, or wav is available, the file type icon will be replaced with a play/pause button for audio streaming. 
02. The File Away menu can be found below the Settings menu on the Admin panel. Begin by configuring your Base Directories.
03. Set permissions, enable/disable some options, choose where to enqueue the CSS and Javascript, etc.
04. Easily create your own custom CSS styles for your lists and tables, using File Away's Custom Styles helpers and the built-in CSS editor, or create your own stylesheet and File Away will enqueue it for you.
05. Here you can reset all your settings to their defaults (be careful with this!), or choose whether to preserve or delete your settings when you uninstall the plugin.
06. A host of extensive tutorials for your reference.
07. The obligatory About page. Nothing to see here.
08. Info links on almost every setting field open up a modal window to give you a clear and detailed understanding of File Away's functionality.
09. The shortcode button on the TinyMCE Panel.
10. The shortcode generator opens up. Begin by selecting your shortcode and the type of display you want.
11. [fileaway] list type shortcode options
12. [fileaway] table type shortcode options
13. [attachaway] list type shortcode options
14. [attachaway] table type shortcode options
15. Info links next to every option open up a modal window to explain exactly what the option does and how you can get the most out of it.
16. A couple of Silk style lists.
17. Here's a Silk list with the Date Modified included.
18. A Minimalist style table: sortable, searchable, paginated.
19. A Silver Bullet style table: sortable, searchable, paginated.
20. Enter a search term in the search field (here: "png") and everything else gets filtered out of the table.
21. Use the File Away iFrame template with your [fileaway] table shortcode and directories enabled, then...
22. Use the [fileaframe] shortcode to embed your iframe-templated page into your parent page, for seamless navigation of your Directory Tree table with no parent-page refreshes and no conflicts with other File Away tables on the same page. 
23. The Manager Mode tab sets access privileges for the Manager Mode options on the Shortcode Generator, and for use of Manager Mode on the front-end.
24. With Directory Tree mode enabled, use the breadcrumbs at the top of the table to navigate backwards, and simply click on the directory name in the table to navigate forward. 
25. With Manager Mode, click at the bottom of the table to enable Bulk Action mode, then just click on the table rows to select the files you want to Copy, Move, or Delete in bulk. The specified action will be performed via Ajax, so no page refreshes. Just some entertaining success dialogs. 
26. Easily rename files right there on the table. If custom data columns are included on the table, File Away will add fields for each custom column present, and automatically format your file name for File Away Custom Data column display, as soon as you press Save. No page refreshes. 
27. See the new tutorial additions, under "Manager Mode," and of course check out all the new shortcode attributes under, well, "Shortcode Attributes."
28. Lots of new options as of version 1.7. 
29. With File Up, you can rename your files before you upload them to your server. 
30. Once you click on File Up to upload them, watch them disappear as they make their way up.
== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Can I upload files to my server, securely from the front-end, using ajax, with File Away? = 
Why of course.
= Does the File Away shortcode include Directory Tree navigation? =
Uh-huh.
= Does the File Away shortcode include subdirectories recursively? =
YES! 
= Are you going to make it so that the File Away shortcode includes subdirectories recursively? =
See above.
= When?!! =
As of version 1.5, some few minutes before the rapid contraction of the universe. 
= I installed the latest update and now the TinyMCE button has disappeared from my page editor. What gives? =
Yeah, that's a weird bug with WordPress's auto-update process that occurs sometimes. To fix, just download the plugin manually and install it via FTP or something.
== Changelog ==
= 2.3.1 = 
* Important bug fix for directory tree and manager mode tables. In my last release I had removed a single period (.) from the code, and I just realized this caused the breadcrumb navigation atop the tables to stop working. So, my bad. It's fixed now. I'm working on a major overhaul of the plugin, but had to get this fix pushed so you can start navigating backwards again. Because what is life if it isn't going forwards and backwards, forwards and backwards. 
= 2.3 =
* Added second audio player option for audio playback. The new alternative will go in the filename column, and has a full control panel. To utilize, just use playback="extended". For backwards compatibility, playback="anything_else" will be rendered as a the original compact version in the filetype column. 
* Added option to restrict the ability to create/delete/rename sub-directories to specified user roles. In other words, you can give a user access to manage/rename/delete files in their own directory, but not to create/rename/delete their own directories. By default, anyone with manager mode access will have directory management access. 
* Fixed bug with bulk action mode security check giving false positive when using dynamic paths. 
* Got rid of a few more notices. 
* Probably did some other stuff. 
= 2.2.5 =
* Added alternate option for thumbnails. Previously, the thumbnails generated were temporary, and were generated on every pageload. You now have the option to generate permanent thumbnail images on initial page load, which means that if a given image already has a thumbnail generated, it will only have to happen once. Every page load after that, the thumbnails will already be there, and won't have to be regenerated. You can choose either option, transient or permanent. 
= 2.2 = 
* Added option in File Away tables to replace filetype icons with image thumbnails generated on the fly for jpg/jpeg, gif and png images. See "Image Thumbnails" in the third column of the Sortable Data Table section on the shortcode generator modal. 
* Got rid of a few more notices. 
= 2.1.1 =
* Fixed white screen of death some people were getting on update. SORRY!
* Got rid of every warning and notice I could find in the admin.
= 2.1 = 
* Added ability to rename and delete directories (recursively), as well as to create new subdirectories, to Manager Mode. All happens inline inside the table.
* Added option to set a fixed upload location, whereas the default allows users to navigate to subdirectories from a dropdown.
* Added option to change the text label on the File Up upload button. 
* Added progress bar to File-Up form, replacing the spinner.
* Updated max upload size function to account for php.ini upload_max_filesize setting.
* Added display of php.ini upload size settings on the info link for the maxsize attribute in the shortcode generator. 
* Fixed some layout issues with the File Up form (hopefully).
* Fixed some issues with the alert script for those who are hosting their directory tree tables in an iframe.
* Removed all white space between HTML elements to cater to silly themes that interpret whitespace as line/paragraph breaks. 
* Fixed minor bug in shortcode generator. 
= 2.0 =
* Now with File Up for secure, front-end, ajax-powered file uploads to your server directories.
* Added if(is_array()) check before sorting files.
= 1.9.4.3 =
* Fixed Playback Mode was not compatible with dynamic paths.
= 1.9.4.2 =
* Fixed Playback Mode skipping non-audio files with same filename as audio files.
= 1.9.4.1 =
* Important: Fixed bug with "select all/clear all" checkbox on Manager Mode tables. 
* Various other minor fixes. 
= 1.9.4 =
* Added optional Bulk Downloads feature for [fileaway type="table"] shortcodes. Bulk Downloads are also automatically now built into Manager Mode tables. 
* Some additional security features. 
= 1.9.3.1 =
* Added 'Skip Confirmation' option for s2member secure file downloads. 
* Re-added missing Playback Loop option on shortcode generator.
* Fixed several minor issues with shortcode generator.
= 1.9.3 =
* Added compat with the s2Member Framework plugin. With s2Member installed and activated, you will automatically have an 's2member-files' option in your Base Directory dropdown options on your shortcode generator modal. 
* When pointing to your s2Member directory, recursiveness, directory tree navigation, and manager mode will be disabled, as will any specified sub directories. Audio playback mode, however, will work fine when pointing to your s2member-files directory.
= 1.9.2 =
* Fixed warnings for empty foreach statements.
* Added option for low-key, non-animated admin settings page.
= 1.9.1 =
* Added looping option to audio playback.
* Added ability to sort attachaway lists by several different parameters, ascending or descending.
* Fixed table disappearing in Directory Tree Mode if no files in a given subdirectory.
* Made shortcode generator options boring, for clarity, and boringness.  
= 1.9.0.1 =
* Fixed typo that was preventing the exclude attribute from working. I had revamped the exclusions system, and didn't catch the typo. 
= 1.9 =
* Oh my God, oh my God, oh MY GOD
* Now with in-table Audio Playback for your audio files. See shortcode generator info links and/or Tutorials tab for details. To activate Audio Playback in your tables, find "The Hymnal" at the bottom of the second column of the Directory Files/Sortable Data Table shortcode generator. 
* Optionally, you can store your playback/sample audio files in a different directory from your audio download files, and they will all show up in the same table row if they have the same filename (not including file extension). 
* You can now exclude directories on a per-shortcode basis, for Directory Tree tables or Recursive tables/lists.
* You can now exclude all directories except for specified directories, on a per-shortcode basis, for Directory Tree tables or  Recursive tables/lists.
* You can now change the directory icon by selecting different options from a dropdown, on a per-shortcode basis.
* You can now change the column heading for Directory Tree tables. Default is "File/Drawer". 
* You can change the column heading for the "Type" column when Audio Playback is enabled. 
* Added optional color scheming and color randomization to tables.
* Revamped shortcode generator modal to make more room for new features. Also fixed a few options that weren't working. 
* Several bug fixes.
= 1.8 =
* Important security updates and bug fixes:
* Added security patch for Manager Mode and Directory Tree Mode when using dynamic paths (e.g., fa-firstlast) in your shortcode. 
* Fixed fatal error when more than one fileaway shortcode on the same page has debug enabled.
* Fixed problem with Attach Away shortcode's file names and download links that was caused by a change made earlier to the File Away shortcode.
* Fixed dumb mistake on shortcode generator modal for the [fileaframe] shortcode. The generator was outputting an attribute "src" which should have been "source"
* Finally think I got rid of the issue of the shortcode button disappearing when updating the plugin via WordPress. Shouldn't happen again. 
= 1.7.7.1 =
* Fixed typo that was preventing File Away icon from showing up on TinyMCE panel
= 1.7.7 =
* Added compat with WP v3.9
= 1.7.6 =
* Important update: Added option to Config page for sites whose WP Install Directory is a Sub Directory of the Site URL: Choose whether to ground your base directories in the WP Install folder or the domain root directory. WP Install Directory is the default. If you change to the latter, refresh the page after it finishes saving, and you'll see the provided abspath in your Base Dir options has changed to reflect your selection. This should resolve all issues for those whose WP Install is in a sub-directory of the Site URL.
= 1.7.5 =
* Minor update: Improved pretty foldernames/filenames by excluding most prepositions and conjunctions from capitalization.
= 1.7.4 =
* Bug Fixes: Manager Mode Copy/Move/Rename/Delete didn't work if source or destination directory had an apostrophe in it. Fixed.
= 1.7.3 =
* Gee Whiz. More bug fixes.
* Fixed the recursive mode, which was, well, broke.
* Fixed inconsistency in Bulk Action mode Destination Directory generator.
* All important stuff, folks. 
* Sigh.
= 1.7.2 =
* Fixed: Directory Tree Navigation was not compatible with WP permalink structure. Now is.
* Fixed: Some general php warnings and notices.
* Please let me know when you find a bug!
= 1.7.1 =
* Important bug fixes in this update, and one item of improved functionality:
* Fixed: Ajax calls not working when scripts set to print to footer.
* Fixed: Manager mode editing functions not working when WordPress is installed in subdirectory of site url (i.e., when WP Site URL and WP Install URL are different).
* Fixed: Files not displaying when (see above).
* Improved: Bulk Action Destination Directory layout: changed label to display block for tables in a tight squeeze.
* New Feature: Select All/Clear All checkbox in Bulk Action Mode with Manager Mode on.
= 1.7 =
* So many big new things in this build, I decided to skip version 1.6 altogether! Please read all the juicy details below:
* First, what isn't here yet but is coming down the line: Front-End multi-file uploading to server directories. Front-End directory creation, directory renaming, directory cloning, directory moving, and directory deletion. Auto-generation of directories for site users, according to desired specifications in desired location. And a bunch more stuff I can't think of at the moment because I haven't slept in days. You're welcome. 
* Bad News: One or two updates ago, I added unlimited Custom Data columns to File Away tables, and told you to separate custom data with a semi-colon. Turns out Safari and sometimes other browsers truncate filenames after semi-colons upon file download. So we had to switch to plain-old comma separation. That means, in your filenames, any commas inside square brackets will be a division marker for custom column display. E.g.: "All-Along-the-Watchtower-[Bob-Dylan,John-Wesley-Harding,Columbia,1968].mp3" will correspond to [fileaway type=table customdata="Artist,Album,Label,Release"]. So anyway, sorry for the change, but we don't want filenames getting truncated on download, AND...
* Good News: Lots of new features, including renaming files on the front-end, with auto-formatting for File Away Custom Columns. I hope that makes up for it. 
* New Feature: Directory Trees. Turn your File Away data table into a Directory Tree for directory navigation. Set the start directory with a static directory name, or a dynamic path, and users will be able to navigate all subdirectories, but no parent directories. 
* Related New Feature: Exclude certain directories from Directory Tree tables, and from Manager Mode access, as a global setting on the File Away Options "Config" tab. 
* New Feature: File Away iFrame shortcode complete with auto-generated File Away iFrame page template, for use with Directory Tree tables, to allow navigation without refreshing the parent page, and to allow for multiple tables on the same page without interference.
* New Feature: Manager Mode. Set access rights according to specified user roles and/or user IDs, and those with privileges can access Manager Mode on the front-end, which allows for Ajax-powered file renaming, file deletion, and bulk file copying, moving, and deletion. Move files to another directory, watch as they disappear, then navigate to that directory and see them in their new home. No page refreshing necessary! 
* You can grant dynamic access to Manager Mode in conjunction with a dynamic path in your shortcode, to allow individual users to manage their own files in their own directories, with no access to others' files.
* Security measures on client and server side to prevent attempts to access directories outside a user's established purview. Attempts to manipulate files in restricted directories will log the user out, and the site administrator will be notified via email of the user's foolhearty nefarious activities. 
* Manager Mode destination directory generator (powered by Ajax) utilizes Chosen's jQuery autocomplete dropdown. Hundreds of directories in a single directory? No worries. Just start typing and watch the others disappear. 
* File renaming fields include jQuery-powered special-character restrictions. 
* Success, error, and confirmation dialogs brought to you by Alertify. 
* Improvement: When pagination is enabled on data tables, the page now scrolls smoothly to the top of the table when a new page is clicked. 
* Bug Fix: Last page number was not being added if only one file on the page. Fixed. 
* All new shortcode attributes updated on the Shortcode Generator modal, including the new [fileaframe] shortcode. 
* 8 new screenshots. 
* Other bug fixes and general improvements. I can't remember everything.
* Enjoy! Now I have to go back to my real job for a while.
= 1.5.1 = 
* Important Bug Fix: Fatal Error when calling two recursive directories on the same page. All better now. Please install this update. 
= 1.5 = 
* RECURSIVE DIRECTORY ITERATION IS HERE. Just add "recursive=ohjeezusitgoeson4ever" to your shortcode (or, I guess, "recursive=anything"), and the files from the specified directory, and all subdirectories, will be output by the shortcode. To disable, just leave the "recusrsive" attribute out of the shortcode.
* Also, bug fixes and some general improvements. Fixed bug with file type icons where file extensions were capitalized. Also fixed dumb bug with the pagesize field on the modal. And some other stuff.
* But Recursion! Infinite Recursion. 
= 1.4 = 
* Expanded Functionality: You can now add an unlimited number of Custom Columns to your File Away tables, using the same method as before. In the shortcode, using the customdata attribute, separate multiple column headings by comma. Then in your file names, inside the square brackets, separate the corresponding data sets by comma.<br><br>
Example Shortcode:<br>
[fileaway type=table customdata="Artist*, Album, Label, Year" sortfirst="custom"]<br>
The asterisk next to "Artist" indicates that sortfirst="custom" should apply to the "Artist" column.<br><br>
Example Filenames:<br>
  My Funny Valentine [Chet Baker, My Funny Valentine, Blue Note, 1994].mp3<br>
  So What [Miles Davis, Kind of Blue, Columbia, 1959].mp3<br>
  Birdland [Weather Report, Heavy Weather, Columbia, 1977].mp3<br><br><br>
Technically, the number of columns you can add is limited only by the size of your WordPress page, and that's really only an aesthetic limitation. 
= 1.3.2 = 
* Bux fixes: Fixed the showto= and hidefrom= attributes. Due to some really inexplicably dumb coding when I originally added this feature, it only worked for the first role in the list. So now I've replaced the really dumb code with some different code that, while not necessarily genius, at least does what it is supposed to do.
= 1.3.1 =
* Bug fixes: Fixed issue with files not displaying to logged out users. Fixed scandir error when using dynamic paths.
= 1.3 =
* Checked compat with WP 3.8.1 - still kicking.
* Fixed issue with WP installations whose WP url and Site url are different.
* Added three new shortcode attributes: 'showto' & 'hidefrom' take comma-separated lists of user roles, and restrict viewing access to the file display based on the logged-in user's role, while 'nolinks=true' disables the hypertext reference portion of the anchor tag, if, for instance, you want to display successful uploads but not provide links to the uploaded files. 
* Narcissism: fixed typo in About tab link to my IMDb page.
= 1.2 =
* Added new shortcode attribute: sortfirst -- Allows user to choose by which column to sort on initial page load (for tables only).
* Added global option on the Basic Configuration page: allows specification of specific file types to open in new window rather than the default download link behavior.
* Added links to two new plugins in the About page.
= 1.1 =
* Moved custom CSS folder from plugin directory to wp-content/uploads/fileaway-custom-css to ensure preservation of custom styles on plugin updates. Be sure to manually back up your custom stylesheet if you have one in the current custom-css folder. You won't ever have to do this again.
